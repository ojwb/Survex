Installing Survex on Unix
=========================

If you are using Debian Linux or Ubuntu Linux or a distribution based
on one of these, you will find it easier to install one of the
prepackaged versions of Survex.

Otherwise you'll need to build from source.  First of all, you need to make
sure you have the required libraries installed.  Where possible it's usually
easier to install these using your Linux distribution's package manager.
Note that C/C++ library packages are usually split into runtime and
development, usually with similar names but with a -dev or -devel or similar
suffix on the development one.  You'll need both to build Survex.

* The main dependency is wxWidgets 3.0 or later - if there's a suitable
  wxWidgets package for your platform, then just use that (note: library
  packages are usually split into runtime and development, usually with the
  same name but with a -dev or -devel or similar suffix on the latter.
  need both to build Survex).

  Otherwise download the source code from https://wxwidgets.org/ and
  follow their build instructions.  IMPORTANT: You must enable OpenGL
  support by adding --with-opengl to the configure command line.

* You'll also need a working C and C++ compiler (with support for C++11), and
  also the OpenGL development libraries if these aren't pulled in by installing
  wxWidgets.

* The PROJ library is needed for coordinate conversion functionality.  Due
  to sweeping changes in the PROJ API, Survex 1.2.x only supports PROJ < 8,
  while for Survex 1.4.x only supports PROJ >= 8.2.0.  There isn't a Survex
  version which supports PROJ 8.0.x or 8.1.x.

* Optionally, FFMPEG is used if available to implement Aven's movie export
  feature.  If not available this feature is disabled.

Then at a shell prompt, unpack the source code, cd into the directory, and
enter the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

By default 'make install' will try to install Survex under /usr/local,
which means you'll probably need to become root for the 'make install' stage.
If you use sudo to manage root access, then:

sudo make install

You can tell configure to install Survex elsewhere (e.g. under your home
directory) like so:

./configure --prefix=/home/olly/survex
make
make install

If your wxWidgets installation isn't picked up automatically, or you
have more than one version installed and want to select a particular
one, then you can specify this like so:

./configure WX_CONFIG=/opt/bin/wx-config

You can use both --prefix and WX_CONFIG= if necessary.
