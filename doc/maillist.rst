The best way to contact the authors and other Survex users is the
Survex mailing list - for details visit:
https://survex.com/maillist.html

We'd be delighted to hear how you get on with Survex and welcome
comments and suggestions for improvements.

And we'd love you to contribute your skills to help make Survex even
better.  Point out areas of the documentation which could be made
clearer, or sections which are missing entirely.  Download test
releases, try them out, and let us know if you find problems or have
suggestions for improvements.  If there's no translation to your
language, you could provide one.  Or if you're a developer, *"Say it
with code"*.  There's plenty to do, so feel free to join in.
