===================
Future Developments
===================

Now that Survex has reached version 1.0, we are continuing progress
towards version 2, in a series of steps, evolving out of Survex 1.0.
The GUI framework is being based on aven, with the printer drivers
and other utility programs being pulled in and integrated into the
menus.

Aven is built on wxWidgets, which means that it can easily support
Linux, other Unix-like platforms, Microsoft Windows, and macOS.

More information on our plans is on the `web site <https://survex.com/>`__.
