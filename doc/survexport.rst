SYNOPSIS
~~~~~~~~

   ``survexport`` [`OPTIONS`] `INPUT_FILE` [`OUTPUT_FILE`]

~~~~~~~~~~~
DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The input formats supports are all those supported by Survex's "img"
library - Survex .3d, Survex .pos, Compass PLT and CMAP XYZ files.

Currently the output formats supported are CSV, DXF, EPS
(Encapsulated PostScript), GPX, HPGL for plotters, JSON, KML, Survex
POS files, Skencil, and SVG.

Also survexport can produce Compass .plt files, which were primarily intended
for importing into Carto; the principal author of Carto has sadly died and it
seems Carto is no longer actively developed, but we've left this support in
place in case it is useful - the generated files can be used with Compass
itself for example, though they are rather crudely structured.

POS Format
~~~~~~~~~~

The POS format is a Survex-specific format containing a list of stations with
coordinates (ordered x,y,z [East, North, Up]) and complete names.  In old
versions of Survex it was produced by the (now removed) ``3dtopos`` tool.
Since Survex 1.2.19 it can be generated by ``survexport`` or by ``aven``'s
export feature.

The header line is translated to the user's language, but always starts with
``(`` and ends with ``)``.

While not a requirement of the format, in ``.pos`` files created by Survex
the stations are sorted by name such that numbers occur in the correct order
(so ``2`` before ``10``).  Numbers with a prefix and/or suffix are sorted by
the prefix as a string, then the number part as above, then by the suffix as
a string, so you'd get:
::

   040.sv8
   040.sv8a
   040.sv8b
   040.sv8c
   040.sv9
   040.sv10
   040.sv11
   40_entrance_tag
   40b_entrance_tag

DXF Format
~~~~~~~~~~

DXF export separates Splays, Surface legs, Surface points, survey
legs, and survey stations onto separate layers.  Splays will export
dotted, and surface legs dashed.  This is not currently configurable.
