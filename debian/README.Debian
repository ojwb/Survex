Survex for Debian
-----------------

Overview
--------

Survex is cave surveying software.  It will process cave survey data entered
as text to produce .3d files containing centreline data.  It can cope with
extremely large datasets, and allows hierarchical arrangement of surveys.
Data can easily be imported from many other programs, and Compass data can
be read natively.

Survex provides a very fast and capable .3d file viewer called aven which
runs under X or Wayland which is in the binary package survex-aven.

Sample Data
-----------

If you want some sample data to experiment with, you can download some from
the Survex website:

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is provided in HTML, text and PDF formats, and is also
online at:

https://survex.com/docs.html

There is a mailing list for users at survex@survex.com - subscribe at:

Vim Support
-----------

The survex package includes vim syntax highlighting for Survex data files,
but this is not enabled per default. If you want to enable it for your user
account run the following command:

    vim-addons install survex

Or to enable it for all users of a system run the following command as root:

    vim-addons -w install survex

vim-addons is provided by the vim-addon-manager package, and you can look
at its manpage for more information.
