Survey contains 4 survey stations, joined by 3 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    2.00m (   1.10m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    2.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 4 at 0.00m to 4 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 0.00m (from 4 at 0.00m to 4 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 1.10m (from 4 at 1.10m to 3 at 0.00m)
