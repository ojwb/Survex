Survey contains 2 survey stations, joined by 1 leg.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    1.23m (   1.23m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    1.20m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.26m
Vertical range = 0.26m (from a.2 at 0.26m to a.1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 0.66m (from a.1 at 0.00m to a.2 at -0.66m)
East-West range = 1.01m (from a.2 at 1.01m to a.1 at 0.00m)
   2 1-nodes.
