Survey contains 5 survey stations, joined by 5 legs.
There is 1 loop.
Total length of survey legs =   13.00m (  11.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =   13.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from c at 0.00m to c at 0.00m)
North-South range = 5.00m (from c at 5.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 4.00m (from 2 at 4.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
