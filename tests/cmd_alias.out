Survey contains 6 survey stations, joined by 5 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    3.00m (   3.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    3.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 3 at 0.00m to 3 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 1.00m (from - at 0.00m to anonymous station at -1.00m)
North-South range = 1.00m (from - at 0.00m to 3 at -1.00m)
East-West range = 2.00m (from 3 at 1.00m to anonymous station at -1.00m)
East-West range = 1.00m (from 3 at 1.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
