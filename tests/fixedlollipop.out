Survey contains 6 survey stations, joined by 6 legs.
There are 2 loops.
Survey has 2 connected components.
Total length of survey legs =   14.00m (  14.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =   14.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from y at 0.00m to y at 0.00m)
North-South range = 5.00m (from y at 5.00m to w at 0.00m)
East-West range = 9.00m (from y at 9.00m to c at -0.00m)
