Survey contains 7 survey stations, joined by 6 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =   60.00m (  60.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =   60.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from magnetic2 at 0.00m to magnetic2 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 0.00m (from grid2 at 0.00m to magnetic2 at -0.00m)
East-West range = 20.00m (from magnetic at 10.00m to magnetic2 at -10.00m)
