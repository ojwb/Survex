Survey contains 11 survey stations, joined by 10 legs.
There is 1 loop.
Survey has 2 connected components.
Total length of survey legs =   21.20m (  21.20m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    4.24m
Total vertical length of survey legs =   19.00m
Vertical range = 14.00m (from anonymous station at 4.00m to anonymous station at -10.00m)
Vertical range = 3.00m (from 2 at 3.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 4.00m (from anonymous station at 4.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 3.00m (from 2 at 3.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 4.00m (from anonymous station at 4.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 3.00m (from 2 at 3.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
