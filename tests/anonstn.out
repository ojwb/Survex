Survey contains 7 survey stations, joined by 6 legs.
There is 1 loop.
Survey has 2 connected components.
Total length of survey legs =   15.00m (  15.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    0.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =   15.00m
Vertical range = 10.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to anonymous station at -10.00m)
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 2.00m (from anonymous station at 2.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
