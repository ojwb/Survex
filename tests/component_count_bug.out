Survey contains 6 survey stations, joined by 5 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    5.00m (   5.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    5.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 0 at 0.00m to 0 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 1.00m (from 0 at 1.00m to _ at 0.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from 0 at 0.00m to 0 at 0.00m)
