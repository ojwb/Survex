Survey contains 3 survey stations, joined by 2 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    2.00m (   4.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    2.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 4.00m (from a at 2.00m to b at -2.00m)
East-West range = 0.00m (from 1 at 0.00m to 1 at 0.00m)
