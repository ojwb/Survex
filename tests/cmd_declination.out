Survey contains 7 survey stations, joined by 6 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =   30.00m (  30.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =   30.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from c.2 at 0.00m to c.2 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 10.00m (from c.1 at 10.00m to c.2 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 10.00m (from c.2 at 10.00m to a.1 at 0.00m)
