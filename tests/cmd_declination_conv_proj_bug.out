Approximate full range of grid convergence: 0.8dg at 2 to 0.8dg at 1
Survey contains 2 survey stations, joined by 1 leg.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =   25.00m (  25.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =   25.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 2 at 225.00m to 2 at 225.00m)
North-South range = 24.93m (from 2 at 6000582.56m to 1 at 6000557.63m)
East-West range = 1.87m (from 1 at 562696.24m to 2 at 562694.37m)
