; Based on reduced testcase posted by Patrick Warren to the mailing list.
;
; The input coordinate system has been changed from OSGB:SD as that was giving
; different output on Linux and macOS depending whether the datum grid is
; installed.
;
; The convergence value was 90-v instead of v with PROJ < 9.3.0.  Survex 1.4.6
; works around the problem.
;
; Also if *cs out was after *declination auto a grid convergence of 0 degrees
; was used - Survex 1.4.6 calculates the convergence lazily which happens when
; we read a compass reading, and gives an error if the output coordinate system
; hasn't been set by then.
