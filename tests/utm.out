Approximate full range of grid convergence: -6.4dg at B2 to -6.4dg at C1
Survey contains 6 survey stations, joined by 5 legs.
There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =    5.39m (   5.39m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    5.29m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.56m
Vertical range = 0.52m (from D1 at 30.52m to C2 at 30.00m)
North-South range = 2.71m (from D1 at 5427954.78m to B2 at 5427952.08m)
East-West range = 1.54m (from D1 at 1313801.45m to C1 at 1313799.91m)
