Survey contains 4 survey stations, joined by 2 legs.
Total length of survey legs =    2.00m (   2.00m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =    2.00m
Total vertical length of survey legs =    0.00m
Vertical range = 0.00m (from 3 at 0.00m to 3 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 1.00m (from 3 at 1.00m to 2 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 1.00m (from 4 at 1.00m to 3 at 0.00m)
